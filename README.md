# Go Echo

This is a simple Go program that will take an HTTP POST request and return the data as JSON, thats it.

This is useful for local development with tools like [Hasura](https://hasura.io/all-features#triggerWebhooks) that use events to trigger webhooks. When developing locally, you can use this Go application (or the associated Docker image) to listen to HTTP responses and echo them.

## Using Go

To use this with Go, install and run like a normal Go program.

## Using Docker

This is the prefered method and should be used with Docker or Docker Compose.
